# GC-EV-fleet
This repository is designed for the analysis of EV vehicles charging sessions.


The development of jupyter notebook is designed to read CSV data, perform data aggregation, and generate a comprehensive CSV output report.  It includes metrics such as the total number of charging sessions, total and average kWh consumption, both on a per-driver basis and for the entire fleet, across different time frames (monthly and yearly). The objective is to offer a detailed analysis of the electric vehicle charging behavior within the specified dataset.
